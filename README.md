# A Feed Forward Trajectory Control Algorithm for Omnidirectional Robots

This repository contains the work developed in the course Mobile Robots of the
doctoral program in Electrical and Computers Engineering (ECE) at the Faculty of
Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP).

A feed-forward trajectory control algorithm was developed specifically for
omnidirectional robots. The algorithm was tested in both simulation and real
environments with a three-wheeled omnidirectional robots intended for the Robot
Soccer Middle Size League. Lastly, two publications were elaborated based on
this work.
